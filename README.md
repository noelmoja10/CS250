# CS250
SNHU Software Development Lifecycle

This repository is exclusive for CS250, where all of the tasks and projects that were made in this course will be submitted in this folder

06/28/25: Submitted my Agile Presentation and Sprint Review for my finals in class CS 250. 

Here are my responses to the question asked in Module 8

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by first listening carefully to what the client wants, then breaking those needs down into clear, manageable tasks. Creating user stories really helped with this because they gave us a simple format to follow—"As a [type of user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]." This helped keep the user's perspective front and center. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, we used user stories to identify key features like selecting destinations or filtering by budget. That made it easier to focus our coding and design efforts around real user goals rather than just technical requirements.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I like to follow a step-by-step approach: understand the user stories, outline the basic structure of the program, then build and test in short cycles. Agile processes made this much easier. I really appreciated using sprints, daily standups, and retrospectives to stay on track and keep communication open with my team. In the future, I definitely want to continue using iterative development, regular team check-ins, and backlog grooming to manage tasks efficiently and adapt to changing requirements.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means more than just doing your part—it’s about collaboration, communication, and support. During the SNHU Travel project, I learned how valuable it is to listen to teammates, share feedback, and step up when someone needs help. Whether it’s writing clean code, testing thoroughly, or just being responsive in meetings, a good team member stays accountable and focused on the group’s success, not just their individual tasks.
